## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Problem 5
#How many potato chips are eaten in Alabama on the 4th of July weekend? 
#sorry I copied this from a word document

 

   # Assuming that the only people eating potato chips are Americans 
   # United States is ~300 million people 
    #The average household is around 4 people 
    #300 mil/ 4 = 75 million households in the U.S. 
    #Assume that Alabama has an equal 50th of the population 
   # 75mil/50 = 1.5 million households 
   # Assume half of those people either don’t celebrate or don’t eat chips 
   # 750,000 households eating chips in Alabama 
    #Size of bags and flavors? 
   # Assume each family buys a “Flavor Mix” bag of 18 small bags and 1 large bag of their favorite flavor 
   # Small bag is 1oz and big bag is 8oz 
   # Each small bag has ~16 chips, each large bag has ~128 chips 
   # 16 x 18 + 128 = 416 chips per family 
   # ¼ are gross flavors, smashed, or go stale 
   # ~104 chips per household consumed 
   # 750,000 celebrating AL households x 104 chips/household = 7.8 million chips
